# Bons-Ptits-Loups

As part of my studies at AFPA, I had to do a 3-month internship to validate my diploma. I designed the website and the web application for the Association Les Bons P'tits Loups. This association is responsible for looking after children during school periods and school holidays. it's more like a daycare.
